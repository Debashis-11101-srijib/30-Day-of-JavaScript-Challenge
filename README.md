## Daily progress
I will be updating this repository daily with my progress, including code snippets, projects, and solutions to the challenges I tackle. Follow along and feel free to provide your feedback and suggestions.

## Day 1: Variables & Data Types
On the first day, I learned about variables and data types in JavaScript. Understanding how to declare and use variables, as well as the different types of data (strings, numbers, booleans, etc.), is fundamental to writing effective JavaScript code.

### Key Concepts Covered:
- Variable declaration using `var`, `let`, and `const`
- **Primitive data types**: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `symbol`
- **Non-primitive data types**: `object` (including arrays and functions)

## Day 2: Operators
On the second day of the 30-Day JavaScript Challenge, I focused on understanding and using various operators in JavaScript. These operators are crucial for performing calculations, making comparisons, and controlling the flow of logic in programs.

### Key Concepts Covered
- **Arithmetic and Assignment Operators** - Perform basic calculations and modify variable values.
- **Comparison and Logical Operators** - Compare values and combine conditions.
- **Ternary Operator** - Use for concise conditional expressions.

----------------------------

## Day 3: Control structures
On the third day of JavaScript Basics! Today, we'll be focusing on control structures. This includes if-else statements, nested if-else statements, switch case statements, and the ternary operator.

### Key Concepts Covered
- **Number Check Script** -  Write a script that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero using `if-else` statements and logs the result.
- **Voting Eligibility Script** - Create a script to check if a person is eligible to vote based on their age and log the result.
- **Day of the Week Script** - Write a script that uses a `switch` case to determine the day of the week based on a number (1-7) and logs the day name.
- **Grade Assignment Script** - Create a script that uses a `switch` case to assign a grade based on a score and logs the grade.
- **Leap Year Check Script** - Write a script that checks if a year is a leap year using multiple conditions and logs the result.

## Day 4: Loops 
On the fourth day of JavaScript Basics! Today, we'll be focusing on loops. This includes for loops, while loops, do...while loops, nested loops, and loop control statements.

### Key Concepts Covered
- **Number Printing Script** - Write a script that prints numbers from 1 to 10 using a `for` loop and `while` loop.
- **Multiplication Table Script** - Create a script that prints the multiplication table of 5 using a `for` loop.
- **Pattern Printing Script** - Write a script that prints a pattern of stars using nested loops.
- **Sum Calculation Script** - Write a script that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 10 using a `while` loop.
- **Factorial Calculation Script** - Create a script that calculates the factorial of a number using a `do...while` loop.
